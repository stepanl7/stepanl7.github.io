  <h2>Sweet Potato Breakfast Skillet</h2>
              <p>
               Ingredients<br/>
               2 medium sweet potatoes or yams <br/>
               1 tablespoon olive oil <br/>
               Salt and pepper to taste <br/>
               3 large eggs <br/>
               1 avocado <br/>
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Instructions<br/>
               Preheat oven to 425 F.<br/>
               Peel and cube potatoes.<br/>
               Toss in olive oil, salt and pepper.<br/>
               Bake on a sheet pan for 25 minutes, flipping once during cooking process.<br/>
               Preheat a medium skillet. Toss cooked sweet potatoes in skillet.<br/>
               Make three one inch areas without sweet potatoes. Crack eggs into hot skillet.<br/>
               Place skillet in oven and bake for 5 minutes, or until eggs are set to your desired level (if you leave them in the pan after removing from oven, they will continue to cook.)<br/>
               Top skillet with diced avocado, salt and pepper. Serve immediately.

  <h2>Perfect chicken</h2>
              <p>
               Ingredients: <br/>
               2-4 boneless chicken breasts with or without rib meat
               1/2 t. salt
               1/2 t. pepper
               1/2 t. garlic powder
               1/2 t. onion powder
               1/2 t. paprika
               2-3 T. olive oil
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Instructions:<br/>
               Mix salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika in a small bowl (I use my old 1/4 cup).<br/>
               Coat the chicken breasts in the seasoning, rubbing in to coat. <br/>
               Pour olive oil in the bottom of a Dutch oven, and heat to med-high. <br/>
               When nice and hot, add chicken to the pan (in batches if necessary).<br/>
               Cook 2-3 min per side. If any chicken has been removed, add it back to the Dutch oven. <br/>
               Place uncovered Dutch oven in a 350 degree F oven for 25 minutes or until juices run clear. <br/>
               Let sit on a plate 5-10 minutes before cutting, shredding, or eating.<br/>

    <h2>New York Steak</h2>
                <p>
                 Ingredients<br/>
                 Approximately 1lb of steak (ribeye, t-bone, or other tender grilling steak) for every two people (1 1/2 – 2” thick)<br/>
                 2 T Avocado oil, olive oil, melted tallow or lard<br/>
                 Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste<br/>
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Instructions<br/>
                 Take the steak out of the package and blot dry with a paper towel. Let it come to room temperature.<br/>
                 Turn your oven on to Broil and place the top rack between six and eight inches below the burner. Put your cast iron pan under the broiler as the oven warms up.<br/>
                 Brush oil on the steak and then season with salt and pepper. Pat the steak so the seasoning sticks.<br/>
                 Turn the burner to High. Remove the cast iron pan from the oven and place it on the hot burner. Let it heat for a minute, then put the steak on the pan. It should hiss and sizzle immediately.<br/>
                 Flip after 30 seconds and repeat on the second side.<br/>
                 Turn off the burner and place the cast iron pan into the oven. Cook the steak for two minutes per side for medium-rare; add one to two minutes per side if you prefer it closer to medium.<br/>
                 Take the pan from the oven and immediately remove the steak to a large plate. Tent with aluminum foil and let it rest for about five minutes.<br/>
                 Cut the steak against the grain and fan the pieces out on each serving plate. Serve immediately.<br/>
